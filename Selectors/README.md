## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. If you are new to these technologies, consider reviewing some introductory tutorials first.

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DeveloperWide/CSS.git
   cd CSS/Selectors
   ``

3. **Open in a Code Editor**: Open the `Selectors` folder in your favorite code editor (such as VS Code).

4. **Open `index.html`**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser or your code editor's live server.

5. **Link the CSS**: Ensure that the `index.html` file is correctly linked to the `styles/main.css` file. The link tag should look like this:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css">
   ```

6. **Follow the Tutorial**: Follow along with the YouTube tutorial, and apply the CSS selectors as instructed.

7. **Practice and Experiment**: Use the `index.html` file to practice different CSS selectors. You can add, modify, and remove HTML elements to see how different selectors work.
